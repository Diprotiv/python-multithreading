### Python-Multithreading-Example
A collection of Python Scripts.


### Background

As we all know, in general, running multiple threads simulteneously is equivalent to running several programs at the same time. In such case, threading in Python is a very popular process to attain concurrency and parallelism. Using threading module in a Python program gives us several key advatages such as sharing same data space and operating on light-weight process in order to avoid unnecessary memory overhead. 

This repository helps us understand usage of Python's threading module in different programs with various requirements. 


### Project Overview

### Project Description  

All the following files are avilable in the 'app' directory.

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)  *Please note that this description section may not be fully
updated as of today as I update this section once a week. You might find more scripts in the acctual application directory*. All scripts have short in-script description on the function of the program.


All scripts/examples used Python's threading module. 

| File Name | Difficulty Devel | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| script_1 | Beginner | This program Print Hello World using threading. |
| script_2 | Beginner | This program adds two given numbers and prints the result. |
| script_3 | Beginner | This program outputs default thread name when the thread is being executed. |
| script_4 | Beginner | A Timer starts its work after a delay, and can be canceled at any point within that delay time period. |
| script_4_1 | Beginner | This program prints 1 to 10 with threading module. |
| script_4 | Beginner | This program handles timer function. |
| script_5 | Beginner | This program creates five threads and each thread prints a string with a two-second interval. |
| script_6 | Beginner | This program takes a string input from user and prints the input in a text file. |
| script_6_1 | Beginner | This program runs five times and each time the program takes two numbers as given input and prints sum of them. |
| script_7 | TBD | TBD |
| script_8 | Beginner | This program creates a thread, officially names it and tries to print the name. |
| script_9 | Beginner | This program prints output of square and cube of a series of numbers. |
| script_10 | TBD | TBD |
| script_11 | Intermediate | This program tries to access the values of args and kwargs. |
| script_12 | TBD | TBD |



### Technical Description / Primary Technologies or concepts Used
  - Python 2.7
  - Multithreading


### How to Run
  - clone the repo
  - install the requirements from requirements.txt file
  - go to the app directory
  - run individual file


### Pre-requisites / Know Before You Go
  - Basic knowledge of Python (version 2.x) is required.
  - Should have basic understanding of Python Multithreading, its importance and usages
  

### Application Functionalities
Becasue this repo is not a project type, in fact it is a collection of several discrete scripts, so their functions are different from one another. Please take a look at the project description to know more about the functionalities of the programs. 
  

### Future Direction / Areas of Improvement
Many more programs to come in each week until the above mentioned expected deadline.
