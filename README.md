:couple: Audience Insights 
====
#### Target Audience
Developers who already have a good understand of Python programming (version 2.x in particular for this repo) and would like to know in details about Python's Threading module. 

#### Purposes
This repository helps us understand different usage of Python's threading module with various requirements. 

#### What to expect
After practicing in all given scripts at least couple of time would help Python's developers having a very solid understanding of Python's threading module, such as, how to write multithreaded Python appliation and/or scripts. 

#### Pre-requisites / Know Before You Go
  - Basic knowledge of Python Multithreading module and its built-in functions
  - Good Knowledge of OOP
  - Good Knowledge of args, and kwargs


:green_book: Project Insights
===
#### Repository Type
This repo is not a complete application or project, rather it's a collection of individual scripts. 

#### Knowledge Base
As we all know, in general, running multiple threads simulteneously is equivalent to running several programs at the same time. In such case, threading in Python is a very popular process to attain concurrency and parallelism. Using threading module in a Python program gives us several key advatages such as sharing same data space and operating on light-weight process in order to avoid unnecessary memory overhead.

#### Functional Description
All the following files are avilable in the 'script' directory.
<br /> *Please note that this description section may not be fully updated as of today as I update this section once a week. You might find more scripts in the acctual application directory. Each script has a concise in-script description of the program.*
