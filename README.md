### Python-Multithreading-Example
A collection of Python Scripts.


### Background

As we all know, in general, running multiple threads simulteneously is equivalent to running several programs at the same time. In such case, threading in Python is a very popular process to attain concurrency and parallelism. Using threading module in a Python program gives us several key advatages such as sharing same data space and operating on light-weight process in order to avoid unnecessary memory overhead. 

This repository helps us understand usage of Python's threading module in different programs with various requirements. 


### Project Overview

| License Type | MIT |


### Project Description  

All the following files are avilable in the 'app' directory.

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)  *Please note that this description section may not be fully
updated as of today as I update this section once a week. You might find more scripts in the acctual application directory*. All scripts have short in-script description on the function of the program.

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| hello_world.py | This is a simple program to print Hello World using threading. A user defined function is created and the function is called when a thread has been initialized. |
| add_number.py | This program adds two numbers and prints the result with thread. |
| for_loop.py | This program adds two numbers and prints the result with thread. |
| add_number.py | This program creates five threads which in turn each will print "Hello World" on the screen. |
| five_threads_prallel.py | This program creates five threads which executed in parallel, each of them will add two numbers and will print the results. |
| acquired_lock.py | TBD |
| square_cube.py | TBD |
| square_cube_v2.py | TBD |
| timer_example.py | TBD |
| timer_with_loop.py | TBD |

### Technical Description / Primary Technologies or concepts Used
  - Python 2.7
  - Multithreading


### How to Run
  - clone the repo
  - install the requirements from requirements.txt file
  - go to the app directory
  - run individual file


### Pre-requisites / Know Before You Go
  - Basic knowledge of Python (version 2.x) is required.
  - Should have basic understanding of Python Multithreading, its importance and usages
  

### Application Functionalities
Becasue this repo is not a project type, in fact it is a collection of several discrete scripts, so their functions are different from one another. Please take a look at the project description to know more about the functionalities of the programs. 
  

### Future Direction / Areas of Improvement
Many more programs to come in each week until the above mentioned expected deadline.
